# 🐍 Python Mini Projects for Beginners

This repo is my personal Python learning journey, filled with simple, terminal-based projects that helped me understand core programming concepts.

📚 Great for:  
- Beginners looking for example projects  
- Anyone learning Python from scratch  
- Reference while building your own small projects

🚀 I add new projects regularly as I learn something new!

💡 Feel free to fork, star, or use the code to practice and learn.

# Python-Mini-Projects
A collection of beginner-friendly terminal-based Python projects created to strengthen my programming skills. These projects explore core programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, functions, and occasionally file handling.

All projects are designed to run in the terminal and do not require a graphical interface.

More projects will be added over time as I continue to learn and practice.

🎯 Valorant Agent Roulette – A Role-Based Agent Picker in Python
This is a simple terminal-based Python script that randomly assigns a Valorant agent to each player based on their chosen role. Players can choose from four main roles, and the script selects a random agent from that category.

📌 How It Works
The script prompts each player to enter their name.

Players choose a role from: Controller, Duelist, Initiator, or Sentinel.

A random agent from the selected role is assigned to each player.

Designed for two players, but can be easily extended for more.

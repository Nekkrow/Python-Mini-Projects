# 🎯 Valorant Agent Roulette – A Role-Based Agent Picker in Python

This is a simple terminal-based Python script that randomly assigns a Valorant agent to each player based on their chosen role. Players can choose from four main roles, and the script selects a random agent from that category.

---

## 📌 How It Works

- The script prompts each player to enter their name.
- Players choose a role from: **Controller, Duelist, Initiator, or Sentinel**.
- A random agent from the selected role is assigned to each player.
- Designed for **two players**, but can be easily extended for more.

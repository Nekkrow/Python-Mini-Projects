# 📦 Inventory Management System – A Command-Line Tool in Python

This is a simple terminal-based inventory management system built using Python. The program allows users to add, view, update, and remove items from a virtual inventory using an interactive menu.

## 📌 How It Works

- Users can:
  - Add new items to the inventory.
  - View current inventory details.
  - Update existing item's quantity and price.
  - Remove items from the inventory.
  - Exit the system.
- Inventory is stored as a dictionary in memory for the current session.
